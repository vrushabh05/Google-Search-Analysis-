# 🌐 Google Search Trends Analysis with Python

Curious about what the world is searching for? In this project, I analyzed global Google search behavior to understand how interest in trending tech topics changes over time and across countries.

Using real-time data from Google Trends, I explored patterns in keywords like **"cloud computing"**, **"data science"**, and **"machine learning"**, visualizing them with beautiful and interactive plots.
